      <h1>Introduction to NFTs</h1>
      <p>NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are digital assets utilizing blockchain technology that are one-of-a-kind and non-interchangeable.
         Each NFT has a distinct identifier, hence making it unique. 
         It also cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, making each NFT distinct. </p>
      <p>NFTs can be considered like a unique item, e.g. an in-game item.
         The data for these items are stored on a digital system known as a Blockchain.
         The blockchain acts as a ledger to verify ownership and transfers on NFTs, which contributes to the security of NFTs and give owners a peace of mind when they acquire an NFT.
         For example, people can make counterfeit copies of an NFT, however the original copy will still belong to the rightful owner based on the blockchain.</p>
