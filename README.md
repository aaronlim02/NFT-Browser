This web application is developed with React for the frontend and Express for the backend. The frontend is connected to external APIs like OpenSea and Alchemy to provide real-time NFT and wallet data. For backend logic, we used Python with Flask, integrating it with the APIs and employing libraries like NumPy for data analysis. We used SQLite as the database to manage user data.
For deployment, we used Firebase Hosting to serve the static website and Firebase Functions to handle API requests, allowing for interaction between the frontend and backend. We containerized the Python Flask server with Docker and deployed it to Google Cloud Run, ensuring scalability and serverless operation. Additionally, we used SQLiteCloud to deploy the database.
